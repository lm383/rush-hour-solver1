# RUSH HOUR SOLVER
This project focuses on writing algorithms that solve the [Rush Hour](http://thinkfun.com/play-online/rush-hour/) game. Both uninformed and informed search algorithms have been implemented. This project includes a number of boards. Board sizes vary from 6x6 to 12x12. Custom boards can easily be created and solved without altering the scripts.
